# FlutterDex

FlutterDex is a Pokedex made with flutter using [Pok√©Api](https://pokeapi.co) for data fetching.

It's good to say that I developed that thinking only for iOS, so maybe you need to do one change or another to run on Android.

## Installation

After cloning this repository, use the following command to install the dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

See more at [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)


## Usage

You use the command `open -a Simulator` to open an iOs emulator or connect your iPhone, then you use `flutter run` to start searching for your favorite Pokemons.
